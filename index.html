						<h2>Community Space</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Ghoomkad is an intentional community space with a heterogenous mixture of people. Some are
technocrats working at Ghoomakad on remote projects, while assisting the space in whatever
manner possible. Then there are musicians composing and creating an ambience as a
complementary backdrop to the lush greenery within the space. Alternate methods of farming
and holistic lifestyle enthusiasts comprise and complete another significant portion of the
denizens of Ghoomakad.

					<p>This is a space where all the denizens of Ghoomakad and elsewhere around Dharamshala
come to network and share workspace. It is called Lotus to bestow metaphorical emphasis on a
centralised and important hub of activity and creation. The building is also situated in the middle
of the property. The seating capacity if for about 15 people, the facilities include high speed
internet, tables and sitting areas with liberal space to work in convenience. This is a great place
to work out of, with potentiality to meet new people and indulge in networking oriented towards
mutual interests, benefits and so on.</p>

						<h2>Day-Treks</h2>

					<p>The founder of Ghoomkad, Mr.Mohinder would take you an emollient and lasting experience
trekking upto the midrange of the Dauladhars. It takes a 10km drive from Ghoomakad and then
a 2km trek until reaching the riverside. This is a place crafted in breathtaking beauty and
bestowed with tranquility. It is the perfect spot for a picnic lunch and sipping some alcohol if you
are up for it.</p>

						<h2>Sustainable and Organic farming</h2>
					</header>
					<p>In simplest terms, we at Ghoomakad are into the production of food, fruits and other plant
products using organic farming and permaculture techniques that protect the environment,
public health and human communities. We also encourage patrons who stay with us to inculcate
this into their lives or spread awareness about these farming techniques. The study of
relationships between organisms and their environment is what all sustainable farming is about.
We have total ‘zero’ dependence on the buy seeds, fertilizers and other equipment from the
market.

The food produced as such is highly nutritional and chemical free.</p>

						<h2>Upcycling</h2>
					</header>
					<p>We consider upcycling as creative reuse, the process of transforming by-products, waste
materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products for better
environmental value. We use ‘Zero Waste’ techniques in implementing this. We have a maker
space and all potential tools to practice upcycling.</p>

						<h2>About the living space:</h2>
					</header>
					<p>This community space can boast without arrogance a splendid view of the Dauladhar range, a refreshing pool, a co-working space, a cafe, an urban farm and lush greenery of sorts. And not forgetting the amazing people there with holistic lifestyles, adventure, innovation and chilldom! It is located in the village Rakkar - not exactly an agricultural hamlet anymore, especially with the onset of roads. The construction is made in an alternative manner - mud hoses, slate roofs and lots of peace.</p>

						<h2>Tent Site</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Situated to the periphery of our farm is the tent site, an exclusive accommodation to instill an experience of outdoors and proximity with nature. There are about 10 cozy tents all equipped to withstand outdoors. There are Eco-toilets towards the far end of the farm crafted in a manner to help obtain manure that can be re-used within the farm, all of this establishes an end to end system of logical and resource dependency within the ecosystem of Ghoomakad. </p>

						<h2>Mountain survival camp</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The location is an exquisite one. A beautiful hut in the midst of the raw nature at the foot of the
giant Dhauladhar, leading to Kundli pass. It is surreal, quiet and full of life there. It is a great
opportunity to connect with nature and mountains and learn about them. Perhaps also about the
self.

This survival camp is all about learning:
1. How to identify dry wood. Cutting and bringing it to the camp.
2. How to cook and wash with least resources
3. How to fix injuries with local herbs and fractures with wood plasters
4. How to carry back an injured or fainted person in the mountains
5. Local folklore and songs
6. About the spirits, herbs and animals of the place – how to live in harmony and respect with
them (basically how not to invite trouble)
7. Way to walk in the mountains</p>
